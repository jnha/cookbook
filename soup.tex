\section{Tomato Soup}

\begin{itemize}
 \item 2 can tomatoes
 \item 1 onion
 \item 3 cloves of garlic
 \item 1 tbs olive oil
 \item 1 cup stock
\end{itemize}

Heat the olive oil in a pot large enough to hold the whole soup.
Saut√© the onion in the oil until it becomes translucent.
Add the garlic and continue until the garic is fragrant.
Add the can of tomatoes and the stock.
Stew until the tomatoes taste cooked.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Blend with a blender, food processor, or food mill to the desired texture.
Serve with grilled cheese.

This recipe is very simple and comes together quickly.
As written it can be made entirely with common ingredients from a pantry
but it can be embellished in various ways.
The stock can be any flavorful cooking liquid, or water if none is available.
Spices can be added, with red pepper flakes and oregano going well with the soup.
Carrots and celery can be added with the onion to add flavor,
this works particularly well if there is no stock.
If the tomatoes are overly acidic, 
a small amount of sugar can be added
or a peeled carrot can be placed in the soup as it simmers to add sweetness.
A small pat of butter can be added at the end to add richness.
